The Chinese culture and education system is not an innovative but an industrious one:

As a result, the types of Chinese innovation that have proven successful recently include:
Taking an western product and localizing it, gradually adding elements of innovation.  After many iterations, the product becomes innovative (example: Tencent QQ learning from ICQ).
Integrating multiple good ideas and creating something new out of it (example: Taobao combining the eBay auction and Google AdWords).
Business innovation: Finding ways to maximize profit (example: freemium model in gaming was first popularized by Giant Interactive).  This is a natural result during China's stage of development -- entrepreneurs and businessmen are largely driven by monetary goals.
Need-driven innovation: Yuan Longping's hybrid rice is a good example -- the government funded research in areas of the greatest need -- in this case hunger from the Cultural Revolution days.

Other areas where Chinese may extend innovation include:
Heavy government subsidy -- areas where the Chinese government heavily subsidizes.  Alternative energy may be the most likely such area.
Innovation that can be derived by exhaustive experimentation -- possibly pharmaceutical area.
Innovation which requires solid foundation and extreme hard work, as opposed to risk-taking and thinking out-of-the-box.
Western-trained researchers leading Chinese teams.

Over time, Chinese innovation will undoubtedly rise, because this is a need that the whole country is aware of.  It may indeed take the 100 years asked in the question.  The American education/research system has a large lead over not just China but the world.
